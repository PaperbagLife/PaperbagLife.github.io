                        Over the winter I created a fully animated 3D animation/simulation of shoppers pathing in a shop.
                        I used Unity navigation to make pathing calculated at real time.
                        I used finalIK to make realistic animations for the shoppers' 3D model.
                        The simulation records paths of each shopper when they choose a destination to walk towards.

                        <i>Sept 2018 - Dec 2018</i><br>
                        In my first year, I worked in a team of 9 people in Game Creation Society.<br>
                        This is a 3D VR hack and slash game using HTC live.<br>
                        I worked on the enemy attack logic and did some testing. <br>

                    <p><b>Couple Trouble - Python, Pygames, OpenCV</b><br>
                        <i>Feb 2020</i><br>

                        I lead a team of 4 to participate in Tartan Hacks 2020.<br> We won the "Best Valentines Hack" award.<br>
                        I was the main programmer in charge of coding the main game.<br>
                        I used OpenCV to implement a control system that detects two different colors.<br>
                        The players has to hold hands wearing rings to control the car and avoid obstacles.<br>
                        If the players do not coordinate well and separate their hands, it's game over.<br>

                    <p><b>CV Shooter- Python, Pygames, OpenCV</b><br>
                        <i>Feb 2020</i><br>

                        This was my 15-112 Project. I scored 97% on this project.<br>
                        It is a top-down space shooter game.<br>
                        I used OpenCV to implement a control system that detects a red color.<br>
                        The game uses a dynamic difficulty system that adjusts itself to the player's performance.<br>
                        The boss has various different attack patterns and a cool laser attack.<br>
