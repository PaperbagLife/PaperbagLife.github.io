### Delivering a Smooth Experience

In my [previous blog post](https://paperbaglife.github.io/#/blogs/2025-06-05-blog-on-github-pages), I talked about how I created a utilities website to track the status of High-Power-Computing (HPC) servers. This was a fun little side project that I could work on intermittently, depending on my workload.

As a complete beginner in user experience, my goal was to get the website into a "working" state as quickly as possible.

For the backend, I quickly whipped up a Flask server in Python and created a systemd service file to run the server. For the frontend, I started with a Vue template and simply added a table to display the statuses. Done.

The result? Upon visiting the page, the web server had to `ssh` into the HPC servers (naively, in a for-loop), run expensive command-line tools, and parse the results. The user had to watch a spinning loading icon for a whole minute while the server fetched the status for all the machines.

The website went live, and I was pretty much the only user.

#### Time to Content: 1 minute

My first instinct was to parallelize the `ssh` commands using threads. This worked, but since the command-line tools still took time, it would still take 10â€“20 seconds for the results to show up.

At this point, several engineers were using the website to check the servers' statuses before running NCCL jobs. One coworker waited for 5 seconds and, seeing nothing, asked if the website was broken. I remember adding a line to the website to mock him for his impatience.

#### Time to Content: 10-20 seconds

After a period of back-to-back tickets, I was finally able to revisit this project. I thought about using a cache since most results were static states most of the time.

I implemented a cache to fetch the status every 30 seconds, save the results, and return the latest result immediately upon receiving a request. (Something something thread safety - just throw a lock on there.) This reduced the time-to-content to less than 1 second.

#### Time to Content: <1 second

At this point, I was pretty satisfied with the website. Over time, I added buttons to help organize various documents and internal links relevant to the project, as well as a cookbook of common commands and knowledge specific to our internal cluster.

Engineers use it daily (at least from 2025-04-20 to the day this was written) to access documents or find commands to run from the Cookbook.

The Cookbook<sup>TM</sup> is another fantastic case study in user experience, and I shall discuss it in the next blog.
